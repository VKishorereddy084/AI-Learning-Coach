# AI-Learning-Coach
The objective of this research project is to create a prototype of a learning coach application using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This project focuses on enhancing the pre-trained model's capabilities through supervised learning techniques to better align with human values and educational goals. 

# Description
The tasks that are involved in this project are:
Task 1: Selecting a learning topic, creating dataset using the topic, perform supervised fine-tuning, build a chatbot, and compare the fine-tuned results with base model results.
Task 2: Publish the source codes.
