# AI Learning Coach application

This project aims to develop a personalized learning coach application using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). By leveraging advanced learning techniques, we enhance the model's ability to align with human educational goals and individual values, providing tailored educational support.

## Key Features and Tasks:

-1. Dataset Creation: Develop a diverse dataset with educational content and feedback for training the model.
-2. Model Refinement: Enhance the model's educational interaction capabilities.
-3. Model Comparison: Evaluate improvements by comparing the refined model to the original.
-4. Implementation: Use Langchain to deploy the refined model in a user-friendly learning coach application(Chatbot).
